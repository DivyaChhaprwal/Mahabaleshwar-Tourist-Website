                <h2>History of Mahabaleshwar</h2>
                </div>
                The first British to set foot here was Sir Charles Malet in 1791. Under General Peter Lodwick and Sir John Malcolm, the Governor of Bombay, a sanatorium was built in 1828. Mahabaleshwar is then considered a British territory and was named ‘Malcolm Pet’ for some years. The bazaar is still named so. Under British rule, roads were built, following which several resorts quickly sprang up. Bungalows, churches and the Mahabaleshwar Club was built. A polo ground and racecourse were opened. In the 19th century, an open jail reformatory center was established. Convicts from China and Malaysia were stationed here. They were involved in constructing roads, grinding corn flour, maintaining potato cultivations and other vegetable gardens in the English resorts. Now, the Public Works Department bungalow stands on the site of the prison. Mahabaleshwar was the summer capital of the Governor of the old Bombay Presidency. The British built various mansions, cottages and bungalows around the town, lending it a charming, sophistication.
